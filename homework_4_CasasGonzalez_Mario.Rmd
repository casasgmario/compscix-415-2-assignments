## Section 5.6.7: #2, #4 and #6 only. Extra Credit: Do #5

### Exercise #2 Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as not_cancelled %>% count(dest) and not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance) (without using count()).


```{r 5.6.7-2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE}

not_cancelled <- flights %>% filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
not_cancelled %>% group_by(dest) %>% summarise(n = sum(!is.na(dep_time)))
not_cancelled %>% group_by(tailnum) %>% summarise(n = sum(distance))


```
